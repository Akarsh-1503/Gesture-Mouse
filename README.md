# GESTURE-MOUSE
Python programming language is used for developing the AI virtual mouse system, and also, OpenCV which is the library for computer vision is used in the AI virtual mouse system. In the proposed AI virtual mouse system, the model makes use of the MediaPipe package for the tracking of the hands and for tracking of the tip of the hands, and also Autopy packages were used for moving around the window screen of the computer for performing functions such as left click, right click, and scrolling functions. The results of the proposed model showed very high accuracy level, and the proposed model can work very well in real-world application with the use of a CPU without the use of a GPU.


# Objective
The main objective of the proposed AI virtual mouse system is to develop an alternative to the regular and traditional mouse system to perform and control the mouse functions, and this can be achieved with the help of a web camera that captures the hand gestures and hand tip and then processes these frames to perform the particular mouse function such as left click, right click, and toggle function.


# Problem Description and Overview
The proposed AI virtual mouse system can be used to overcome problems in the real world such as situations where there is no space to use a physical mouse and also for the persons who have problems in their hands and are not able to control a physical mouse. Also, amidst of the COVID-19 situation, it is not safe to use the devices by touching them because it may result in a possible situation of spread of the virus by touching the devices, so the proposed AI virtual mouse can be used to overcome these problems since hand gesture and hand Tip detection is used to control the PC mouse functions by using a webcam or a built-in camera.



A model of hand landmark consists of locating 21 joint or knuckle co-ordinates in the hand region, as shown:

#  Methodology
The various functions and conditions used in the system are explained in the flowchart of the real-time AI virtual mouse system:

# Limitation
The proposed AI virtual mouse has some limitations such as small decrease in accuracy of the right click mouse function and also the model has some difficulties in executing clicking and dragging to select the text. These are some of the limitations of the proposed AI virtual mouse system, and these limitations will be overcome in our future work.



#  Conclusions
The main objective of the AI virtual mouse system is to control the mouse cursor functions by using the hand gestures instead of using a physical mouse. The proposed system can be achieved by using a webcam or a built-in camera which detects the hand gestures and hand tip and processes these frames to perform the particular mouse functions.

From the results of the model, we can come to a conclusion that the proposed AI virtual mouse system has performed very well. The proposed AI virtual mouse can be used for real-world applications, and also, it can be used to reduce the spread of COVID-19, since the proposed mouse system can be used virtually using hand gestures without using the traditional physical mouse.
