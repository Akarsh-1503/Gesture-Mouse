# GESTURE-MOUSE

#Objective
The main objective of the proposed AI virtual mouse system is to develop an alternative to the regular and traditional mouse system to perform and control the mouse functions, and this can be achieved with the help of a web camera that captures the hand gestures and hand tip and then processes these frames to perform the particular mouse function such as left click, right click, and toggle function.


# Problem Description and Overview
The proposed AI virtual mouse system can be used to overcome problems in the real world such as situations where there is no space to use a physical mouse and also for the persons who have problems in their hands and are not able to control a physical mouse. Also, amidst of the COVID-19 situation, it is not safe to use the devices by touching them because it may result in a possible situation of spread of the virus by touching the devices, so the proposed AI virtual mouse can be used to overcome these problems since hand gesture and hand Tip detection is used to control the PC mouse functions by using a webcam or a built-in camera.
